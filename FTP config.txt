Configuration of File Transfer Protocol(FTP) Server in RHEL8

--To transfer or copy files from one machine to another using FTP config
[server machine]
#dnf repolist

Install ftp and vsftpd
#yum install ftp vsftpd -y

Now go to main configuration file of ftp and make some changes
#vim /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
Allow the following 
anonymous_enable= YES
:wq!

Now we have to enable and start ftp services
#systemctl start vsftpd.service
#systemctl enable vsftpd.service
#systemctl status vsftpd.service

Now add ftp to firewall to give access to share files
#firewall-cmd --list-all
#firewall-cmd --add-service=ftp --permanent
#firewall-cmd --reload

To check our ftp is working or not open chrome and type our ip address
#ip addr
chrome--ftp:192.168.232.4

Now lets move to default folder of FTP
#cd /var/ftp/pub
#ls
#cal > cal.txt
#cat cal.txt

To login as anonymous 
#ftp localhost
name: anonymous
passwd: abc@gmail.com
login succsful
ftp>ls
pub
ftp>cd pub
cal.txt
ftp>cat cal.txt
ftp>bye


How can we login by user to login to ftp server

#su -adminuser

#ftp localhost
password: Mahesh@143

ftp>ls

here we can see our adminuser files but in anonymous we have seen the public (pub) folders, if we use anonymous for login the files will be shown by the server

--open cmd windows 
ftp 192.168.232.4
name:anonymous(also you can login as user also)
passwd:maheswarreddy5931@gmail.com
ftp>ls
ftp>cd pub
ftp>get cal.txt
to copy multiple files at a time
ftp>mget cal.txt mahi1 mahi2
also you can put your files to ftp
ftp>put filename
now lets see is filename is copied or not in server machine its copied
ftp>bye or quit

it will be saved to the windows machine

Now lets login to client machine to copy files from server

#yum install ftp vsftpd
start the service
ftp 192.168.232.4
name:adminuser
password:
and from here u can copy files and shae files through the ftp 
--By using ftp we can tranfer files to client to server or server to client we can also copy files

To disable the anonymous we have to modify the config file
#vim /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
anonymous_enable=NO
#systemctl restart vsftpd

Now if we login through broweser it will ask for username and password

Now to use a specific file as anonymous folder we have modify
#mkdir /ftp
#vim /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
anonymous_enable=NO
at the last of doucument add
anon_root=/ftp
:wq!
#systemctl restart vsftpd

now if we login as anonymous it will login successful but will not show the files or folders it will through failed

to over come that 
go to 
#ls -ldZ /var/ftp/pub
its context islis :public_content_t
Now we have to modify same above to our dir /ftp
#ls -ldZ /ftp
#chcon -t public_content_t /ftp
#ls -ldZ /ftp

#systemctl restart vsftpd

Now we can abel to login and access the /ftp files
